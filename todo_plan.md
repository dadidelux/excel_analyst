### 6.2 Packaging & Distribution
- [ ] Create setup.py or pyproject.toml
- [ ] Add Docker configuration (optional)
- [ ] Create installation instructions
- [ ] Prepare for distribution

## Sample Test Cases

### Test Data Scenarios
- [ ] Sales data with store/non-store categories
- [ ] Time-series data for trend analysis
- [ ] Multi-category performance data
- [ ] Data with missing values and outliers

### Sample Queries to Support
- [ ] "Compare store vs non-store sales performance"
- [ ] "Show correlation between store and non-store sales over time"
- [ ] "What are the top performing categories by month?"
- [ ] "Identify trends and seasonal patterns"
- [ ] "Create a dashboard-style summary of key metrics"

## Success Criteria
