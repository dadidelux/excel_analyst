I wanna build ang langgraph agent 

that I will lets say load a csv then 

it will let me query

then lets say my query is "Compare store vs non-store sales performance and see if there is a connection with store sales to non-store sales over time, please provide a chart to help illustrate"

it will then provide anything analysis then will save it to a sheet

basically the final outcome is the actual data that was loaded 
in and the analysis on another sheet but basically same file
also it shows the tables and charts in the excel sheet
